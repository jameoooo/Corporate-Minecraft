Tiers All custom armor have four tiers, marked by the number of stars (\u272a) in a piece's name. Craftable custom armor tiers are set according to the tiers of the fragments used to craft them. Dropped custom armor tiers are randomized, with higher tiers being more rare. Some armor sets scale harder than others. For example, tier (\u272a) of armor set A may have lower stats than tier (\u272a) of armor set B, but tier (\u272a\u272a\u272a\u272a) of armor set A may have higher stats than tier (\u272a\u272a\u272a\u272a) of armor set B. Armor Drops Many armor pieces are random drops from custom mobs. Some armor pieces are more rare than others. With some exceptions, each tier higher of armor has half the chance of the previous tier to drop. This means that a tier (\u272a\u272a\u272a\u272a) armor piece has 1/64th the chance of a tier (\u272a) armor piece to drop. Armor that is dropped from mobs can be crafted into a higher tier.

The first three are standard Minecraft dimensions, with more advanced terrain generation: Grynn: Scorch: Veil: Once these three dimensions are beat by the player (including killing all custom bosses) they can access the Shattered Realms, uniquely generated worlds that offer entirely new experiences: Airthaal: Nohrm: After beating these dimensions, players will be able to travel to Iskk, a harsh world made entirely out of snow biomes. Custom Mobs This server features over 100 custom mobs, each of which has its own unique flare, drops, loadouts, etc. Some custom mobs have Custom Bosses This server features eight custom bosses. Of the first three dimensions (Grynn, Scorch, and Nohrm), there are one boss each with a fourth boss able to be summoned after killing all three. The Shattered Realms dimensions (Airthaal and Nohrm) follow a similar structure - one boss on each world, and a final boss summoned after killing them. Iskk has a boss as well. These bosses are meant to be very difficult. You should come as prepared as possible to fight them. Or cheese them, if you want to ruin all of my hard work. Custom Items This server features over a hundred custom items, ranging largely from armor to weapons. These are discussed in more detail in Custom Items . Pets Pets are purchased with money and can be used for a variety of purposes. Upon purchasing a pet, you will be prompted to select a skill tree for the pet - skill trees cannot be changed and determine what the pet can do.

From Nether ores, you can obtain Blazed Fluxes; from Overworld ores, you can obtain Basic Flux. Gemstones also occur in both worlds, all with a base drop chance of 2% from their respective ores. Additionally, ores can drop Mysterious Dust and artifacts, which require more detail than the former items. Note that using a silk touch enchanted pickaxe on ores does not yield PyroMining drops. Both Flux types have no other use with PyroMining, and can be sold directly to /mine shop. Gemstones can also be sold directly to /mine shop, but you also have the opportunity to increase their value before you sell them, at the risk of instead decreasing their value. This gamble is referred to as \u201cexamining the quality\u201d of the gemstone, and is done simply by right-clicking the item while holding it. If you are holding multiple of the same gemstone when you do this, only one will be identified. If your inventory is full, it will drop on the ground. An identified gemstone may then be sold to /mine shop, having no further uses or functionalities. Gemstone Source Ore Peridot Coal Amethyst Lapis Ruby Redstone Sapphire Emerald Tiger\u2019s Eye Diamond Topaz Nether Quartz Zeta PyroMining comes with a crucial custom currency known as Zeta, which is required for some passive upgrades, being able to craft Vessels (custom pickaxe enchantments), and other miscellaneous actions. Zeta is earned as you mine ores (Zeta earned scales with ore value), or in the form of Zeta Tears when dropped from Oracles (one of the miniboss types) or artifacts (an item dropped when mining). Zeta Tears are worth 10,000 Zeta when redeemed, and you can withdraw Zeta from your own balance in the /mine vessels menu. Check your Zeta balance using /mine zeta. Zeta Tears, as an item, are exchangeable with other players and usable in other server economic means such as the auction house and chest shops. Player Stats PyroMining will track for you your productivity in terms of flux acquisition, money you\u2019ve made, gemstones you\u2019ve found, Rune Guardians and Oracles you\u2019ve killed, and the number of artifacts you\u2019ve handled. More importantly, though, /mine stats will inform you of your current Zeta balance and PyroMining level and experience progress. Your PyroMining level is not the same as your Skills mining level, nor, if applicable, is it related to your Jobs mining level. Your PyroMining level affects which Vessels you are permitted to craft and your ability to summon Oracles (minimum level 40). PyroMining does not use a skill tree progression that\u2019s based on your level (see Singularity for its equivalent). Artifacts Artifacts are items dropped when mining ores with a 1% base drop chance, and are the primary way to obtain many of the other PyroMining items. When initially obtained, artifacts are sealed; sealed artifacts are stackable, while unsealed ones are not. Sealed artifacts must be unsealed by right-clicking them in your hand before you can do anything else with them (unless you want to sell/purchase sealed artifacts via other server economical means such as the auction house or chest shops. Also note the use of Ancient Relics, explained below). Once an artifact has been unsealed, it can either be sold to /mine shop for server money, or you can \u201cidentify\u201d it in /mine artifacts by placing it in one of the iron bar slots and collecting its contents later after its timer has run out. Artifact timers continue when you are offline. You will notice that artifacts have different tiers. These different tiers correlate with how easily they are obtained, how long they take to identify, and how good the rewards are. Artifacts are the only way (other than from other players) to obtain fossils, which are used to craft Vessels (custom pickaxe enchantments). Tier III and higher artifacts are the only way (other than from other players) to obtain Requium Orbs, which are required when working with Vessels. There is a small chance, especially at lower tiers, for an artifact to award nothing. For the most part, artifacts will award mineral ores, of which redstone and emerald ores are necessary to summon Rune Guardians and Oracles respectively (both are minibosses). Once you have begun identifying an artifact, hovering over its corresponding minecart will tell you what items it may award, and with what chances. Both of these (items and their chances) are somewhat randomized even among artifacts of the same tier. Every artifact has a chance to drop a fossil; these are also randomized though they generally scale up with the artifact\u2019s tier. PyroMining-specific drops to keep an eye out for include Zeta Tears, Mysterious Dust, Rune Dust, and Ancient Relics (explained below). Refinery A refinery is a two-block structure consisting of a dropper and an oak fence post. This structure is required to process your mysterious dust into other usable items, as well as for crafting Vessels (custom pickaxe enchantments) out of identified Fossils. Build: Place a dropper facing upward, and the oak fence on top of it. It is okay for the fence to attach itself sideways to an adjoining wall. Use: Place mysterious dust, or all 8 identified fossils of a set, into the dropper. Mysterious dust can be placed in stacks. Then right click the fence. The resulting item from mysterious dust will be placed directly in your inventory, or at your feet if your inventory is full. If crafting a Vessel from the fossil set, the vessel item will plop beside the dropper after a long, dramatic pause and some mechanical noises. Mysterious Dust Mysterious dust drops from mining ores, and can also be obtained from identified artifacts. When refined, mysterious dust may return nothing, one item, or more than one item. Refer to the refinery to properly use mysterious dust. At all PyroMining levels, it has a 75% chance of returning Rune Dust. At level 20 or higher, there is a 2% chance to obtain Oracleite (uncharged, later used to summon the first Oracle miniboss). At level 25 or higher, there is a 4% chance to receive Ancient Relic. At level 30 and greater, Shattered Requium Orbs may drop. Singularity & Runes The PyroMining \u201cskill tree\u201d is based around a system known as Singularity, which is directly tied with the acquisition of Runes as opposed to your PyroMining level. Access this upgrades menu using /mine singularity. This allows you to check what your current singularity level is overall, and how many points you have available to designate towards passive upgrades. Singularity level has no limitation, but it takes an increasing number of runes to upgrade your singularity each level. The cost to upgrade is all previously required runes plus one additional rune. For instance, if you required 1x Fairy Rune and 1x Ghost Rune when leveling your singularity up to 2, your level 3 upgrade will also require 1x Fairy Rune and 1x Ghost Rune, plus another rune (new or repeated). Each player requires different runes to upgrade their singularity, so trading or bartering with runes may be a good way to help each other. Rune Guardians Rune Guardians are side minibosses from which you can obtain elemental Runes. Increasing quantities of runes are required to upgrade your PyroMining passive skills in /mine singularity. Rune Dust has a 75% chance to drop at all PyroMininng levels from refining mysterious dust, and a variable chance to drop from identifying artifacts in /mine artifacts. Right click a rune dust onto a redstone ore to open the rune guardian spawning menu. You may either spend one rune dust to spawn a random Rune Guardian, or three to spawn a specific one. This latter option is useful when you\u2019re targeting specific runes to upgrade your singularity. Rune Guardians have different strengths and abilities based on their element; there are seven elements: fire, ghost, lightning, fairy, ground, nature, and water. Killing a rune guardian has a chance to drop the respective elemental rune. This chance can be improved via upgrade in /mine singularity. Passive Effect Requium Progress Grants more Requium XP (anger) for each thrall killed. Rune Drop Chance Increases drop chance for runes from rune guardians. Oracle Damage Reduces damage absorbed from Oracle attacks. Cheaper Upgrades Makes zeta-based upgrades cheaper in /mine artifacts. More Zeta Increases zeta yield from all sources. Oracles Oracles are a series of very high-level, increasingly difficult, side minibosses which drop very useful special items that can be used to influence your everyday PyroMining activities. Summoning an oracle requires a PyroMining level of 40+ (check your level in /mine stats). It is highly recommended that you do not attempt to take on Oracles on your own; they are significantly more difficult than Rune Guardians, having more than 4x the health. There is a one-hour cooldown to summon the same Oracle. Uncharged Oracleite is obtained from refining Mysterious Dust with a 2% chance to drop when Level 20+. Uncharged Oracelite must receive 35 charge before it becomes Charged Oracleite; charge it by mining diamond ore with one Oracleite in your offhand. Charged Oracleite is used to spawn the first of three Oracles when right-clicked onto an emerald ore. This opens the oracles menu, allowing you to confirm the summoning of Radalite. When an Oracle is killed, it always drops the rune required to summon the next one. When fighting any Oracle, behaviors include teleporting to you and spawning minions (in the form of vexes) to also fight you. Radalite Spawn Radalite, the first oracle, by right clicking a Charged Oracleite onto an emerald ore and confirming the spawn in the menu. Lore: She is fire based and deals bonus damage when she is fought in water. She will set the world on fire with her fiery abilities. Drops: 1-10x Rune Dust (65% chance) - Used to summon Rune Guardians 1-2x Zeta Tear (50% chance) - Redeem for 10,000 Zeta each 1x Fabled (VI) Artifact (75% chance) - Identify for loot in /mine artifacts 1x Mythic (VII) Artifact (60% chance) - Identify for loot in /mine artifacts 1-10x Radalite Claw (guaranteed) - Removes cooldown to summon Rune Guardians 1x Fossil Transmuter (65% chance) - Converts up to 3 stacked fossils into another fossil of the same body type. Useful in conjunction with Bone Marrow. 1x Hell Rune - Required to summon the next Oracle, Impulse Impulse Spawn Impulse, the second successive oracle, by right clicking a Hell Rune onto an emerald ore and confirming the spawn in the menu. Lore: He focuses mainly on electricity, casting lightning and dealing Area-of-Effect (AoE) damage and zoning out attackers before they get close. Careful when killing him as he likes to explode! Drops: 1-3x Zeta Tears (50% chance) - Redeem for 10,000 Zeta each 1x Celestial (VIII) Artifact (75% chance) - Identify for loot in /mine artifacts 1x Divine (IX) Artifact (60% chance) - Identify for loot in /mine artifacts 1-4x Ancient Relic (75% chance) - Used on an artifact to upgrade its tier 1x Bone Marrow (50% chance) - Duplicates a fossil. Useful when used with Fossil Transmuter 1x Light Rune - Required to summon the next Oracle, Tohka Tohka This oracle appears to not be fully implemented yet, though you will receive the Light Rune from Impulse which is used to spawn Tohka. Lore: She is based around Darkness and is not to be taken lightly. She will swap resistances every 20 seconds and become immune to all damage except from the source she states at the time of the swap. She will also summon minions to help fight. When she loses 500 health she will cast Astral Starfall which will constantly damage players in a huge radius. When she reaches 300 health she will cast Astral Empire which buffs all her stats and will deal large amounts of damage. Drops: Drops: 1-7x Zeta Tear (70% chance) - Redeem for 10,000 Zeta each 1x Celestial (VIII) Artifact (90% chance) - Identify for loot in /mine artifacts 1x Divine (IX) Artifact (75% chance) - Identify for loot in /mine artifacts 1x Abyssal Accelerator (60% chance) - Instantly finishes all items in Artifact Identifier /mine artifacts 1x Abyssal Shard (80% chance) - Duplicates a Requium Orb 1-12x Astralite (50% chance) - Used to upgrade and craft Astralite Gear. This is a Blacksmithing feature not yet available in PyroMining, thus the item is not available in-game. 1x Astral Rune - Function unknown, unavailable in-game. Likely pertains to Blacksmithing in the future. Vessels (Custom Enchantments) Nomenclature~ The term \u201cvessel\u201d refers to multiple forms, so they will be used here as such: Vessel item - refers to the item that is crafted, which is then applied to a pickaxe Vessel progression - refers to the state of the pickaxe after the item has been applied but before the enchantment takes effect. This state is indicated by your pickaxe being temporarily renamed with the vessel name. Vessel boss - refers to the mob that must be fought, whose defeat applies the enchantment to the pickaxe Vessel enchantment - refers to the enchantment on the pickaxe after defeating the boss The wording here does not necessarily reflect the verbage used by the plugin developers, but is written such that it is hopefully more clear to you as a player. Vessels are a handful of things but ultimately they are custom enchantments for pickaxes that you have to put work into. Once you have crafted a vessel item from a refinery, you can apply that vessel item to a pickaxe by dragging it and clicking it onto your pickaxe. Performing this action initiates a vessel progression specific to that pickaxe. The vessel item is the only state in which vessels are transferable between players. Obtaining a vessel item and applying it to your pickaxe is not the end that gets you a fancy new enchantment on your pickaxe, but rather a beginning of a process to get that enchantment. Vessel Progression The vessel progression is the long, bumpy road to getting a vessel enchantment on your pickaxe. When you apply the vessel item to the pickaxe, your pickaxe will be renamed to indicate the vessel enchantment towards which you are now working. You may only have one vessel progression applied to a pickaxe at a time, and the same vessel type does not stack for progression. During the vessel progression, use your pickaxe normally, but know that each ore you mine could be the death of you, as there is now a chance for the vessel boss to spawn. This spawn chance is extremely low \u2013 less than 1%, but you should stay weary as vessel bosses are not meant to be easy. The vessel boss is not the only creature you could encounter during the vessel progression. Thralls are small mobs (silverfish) which also emerge from the ores you mine on occasion. As you kill these little critters, you gain Requium XP, or anger, towards your vessel progression. The timespan with which you deal with the vessel progression is affected by your preparedness in another area: requiums. Each vessel progression, even for the same vessel type, requires a different requium ordering. Without the correct requium ordering, you are not permitted to kill the vessel boss. Fossils Unidentified fossils are obtained from identifying artifacts. To identify a fossil, place it back in /mine artifacts. The time to identify a fossil is one hour. Fossils come from three different creatures: dragon, manticore, and phoenix, and there are 13 uniquely named creatures which translate directly into 13 unique Vessels. An unidentified fossil will indicate the creature type, while an identified fossil will assign a name to it. There are eight fossil parts belonging to each vessel creature: skull, arm, spine, rib, tail, wing, leg, and foot. Having all eight of those parts for a single creature will allow you to craft a vessel item in a refinery. See refinery page for information on converting your identified fossil collection into a vessel item. Each vessel costs Zeta and requires a minimum PyroMining level to be crafted from fossils. Vessel Name Minimum Level Zeta Cost Nagyns\u2019 Vessel 5 95,000 Necros\u2019 Vessel 5 95,000 Neptulus\u2019 Vessel 5 75,000 Imperos\u2019 Vessel 5 75,000 Seraphs\u2019 Vessel 8 145,000 Auroras\u2019 Vessel 12 120,000 Nefaris\u2019 Vessel 18 140,000 Valakas\u2019 Vessel 22 175,000 Skylarks\u2019 Vessel 25 150,000 Rezoths\u2019 Vessel 30 200,000 Xostrans\u2019 Vessel 35 162,500 Mementos\u2019 Vessel 40 300,000 Requium Orbs Requium orbs, if not recovered from shattered requium orbs, are found in tier III and higher artifacts. You can improve your chances of obtaining requium orbs from artifacts by upgrading the Final Whisper passive in the /mine artifacts menu. There are 12 different orbs which can be collected, and thus required at random: Aleph, Bet, Daleth, Gimel, Heh, Het, Tet, Vav, Yud, Yud Aleph, Yud Bet, and Zayin. Three random requium orbs are required to kill each vessel boss. To use them, head to the /mine vessels menu with your vessel-progressing pickaxe in your inventory. Once you\u2019ve opened the menu, pick up your pickaxe. This will select it for the menu so that any requiums you move are directly associated with that particular pickaxe. The anvil\u2019s wording says \u201cClick Your Pickaxe.\u201d With your pickaxe loaded, you should now be able to freely move requium orbs into and out of the three slots below the iron bars. Simply exit the menu to save your chosen requium placements. When you are fighting the vessel boss, these slots are checked for what requiums you have placed in them, consecutively. If it performs the check and the requium orb is correct, the vessel boss\u2019 \u201cshield\u201d partly breaks down and you may continue to fight the vessel boss. If it performs the check but finds an incorrect requium orb in the slot, the vessel boss immediately starts a despawn counter and soon thereafter disappears, leaving you with the knowledge that a particular requium orb does not go in a particular slot. Getting the correct ordering of requium orbs can be done by guesswork \u2013 set random requiums, and the next time the vessel boss spawns, see if they are consecutively correct. You\u2019ll receive a chat message with the requium mentioned in green when it is correct, and the /mine vessels menu will then update to state the requium for that slot since you\u2019ve figured it out. This is not a particularly efficient method, though, as there are 12 possible requiums and 3 slots that you\u2019d have to guess correctly, changing them out for each new spawn of the vessel boss just to guess. It is recommended, though, to set the first one or two requiums immediately after applying the vessel item to your pickaxe, so that you can at least start ticking requiums off the list at the first random spawn of the vessel boss. Failed attempts do not consume your requium orbs; they can be withdrawn after the vessel boss has despawned. Fortunately, there is a system that works toward directly telling you what each of the requiums should be, and that is through thralls and requium XP (also called \u201canger\u201d). See below for more details on thralls and their role in the vessel progression. Note that the requium ordering for one vessel progression differs from the requium ordering for other vessel progressions. For instance, if you\u2019ve applied Valakas Nightfall to your pickaxe, and used the requiums Yud Bet, Aleph, and Vav when you defeated Valakas the first time, the next time you are working towards Valakas Nightfall may instead require Yud Aleph, Bet, and Zayin to defeat Valakas again, or any other combination of requiums. If you have placed all three requiums correctly, you will be able to proceed with killing the vessel boss. Defeating the vessel boss returns three shattered requium orbs and immediately applies the vessel enchantment to the pickaxe on which the vessel progression was applied (and returns the pickaxe\u2019s name to normal as well). This is the end of the vessel progression and, as the PyroMining informational menus say it, you have defeated the vessel. Shattered Requium Orbs: Obtainable from refining mysterious dust and after defeating a vessel boss (three are dropped from killing the vessel boss). These represent fragments of a requium orb, and every four shattered pieces can be recombined to form a random requium orb. To convert, hold a stack of four or more shattered requium orbs and right click. Four of them will be consumed and you will be given a requium orb in their place which can then be used as normal. Thralls Thralls are small hostile mobs \u2013 specifically silverfish \u2013 which have a small chance to spawn when you are mining ores using a pickaxe imbued with a vessel progression. A vessel progression is so-called (here, at least) primarily because of the succession of \u201canger\u201d that a vessel develops. The anger stat can be viewed after selecting your pickaxe when in the /mine vessels menu, and the levels include Indifferent (default), Annoyed (100%-199% anger), Furious (200-299% anger), and Fuming (300-399% anger). The value in anger, though, is its percentage increase on each requium slot (seen by hovering over the iron bars in /mine vessels). When the anger for a requium slot reaches 100%, the expected requium orb for that slot is revealed. Anger towards requium slots affects one slot at a time and proceeds in order. It can be progressed such that you\u2019re eventually told all three required requiums. Each thrall you kill increases the anger percentage. The XP yield from thralls can be upgraded with the Requium Progress passive in /mine singularity. Without upgrades, it takes around 14+ thralls to reveal a required requium. You can increase your chance of spawning thralls with Necros Realm on your pickaxe. Anger resets for each new vessel progression. Vessel Miniboss To finish applying a vessel to your pickaxe, you must defeat the vessel boss. The vessel boss has a very small chance to spawn when you mine ores with your pickaxe having the vessel progression. When the boss has spawned, you will temporarily lose access to /mine vessels and the requiums that you have set at the time will be used to attempt to defeat the boss. The vessel boss continues to have a chance to respawn until you have defeated it. The level of the vessel boss, and its corresponding thralls, will depend on the total number of vessels you have already applied to your pickaxe. Eg. if you have Nagyns Tranquility II and Valaks Nightfall I on your pickaxe, the vessel boss will be level 4. Vessel bosses have a chance to spawn with a random quirk, granting the vessel boss a small advantage. You can check which quirk, if any, your vessel boss will have by looking at the stats in /mine vessels. Possible Quirks Fire damage immunity Projectile immunity Slowness immunity Life steal Armor piercing Enhanced speed Info & Enchants Vessel enchantments will apply to your pickaxe immediately after you kill the vessel boss (it is assumed your pickaxe will be in your inventory at this time, as it only spawns when mining with the pickaxe). Each vessel can be added on more than once to increase its effects and overall level; if there is already one or more levels of the vessel enchantment on the pickaxe, defeating the vessel boss increases that level by one.

Removing the vessels from your pickaxe clears any PyroMining data on the pickaxe and returns to your inventory a vessel item for each vessel enchantment and each level of the vessel enchantments that were on the pickaxe, and a vessel item for an incomplete vessel progression, if applicable. For instance: if you had Seraphs Grasp III and Mementos Stopwatch I on your pickaxe, with a Xostrans Glare progression going, you would be given 3x Seraphs\u2019 Vessel, 1x Mementos\u2019 Vessel, and 1x Xostrans\u2019 Vessel.","title":"PyroMining"},{"location":"pyromining/#pyromining","text":"PyroMining does not have its own wiki, and this is the closest thing.","title":"PyroMining"},{"location":"pyromining/#command-summary","text":"/mine or /mine menu - open PyroMining home menu /mine journal - view basic information on the various aspects of PyroMining /mine help - view list of available commands /mine stats - view all your PyroMining statistics including level /mine zeta - view your Zeta balance /mine shop - access PyroMining shop to sell fluxes, gemstones, and/or artifacts /mine singularity - upgrade skill tree and check rune requirements /mine artifacts - open the artifacts menu to identify artifacts or fossils and to upgrade artifact passives /mine vessels - open the menu to check current Vessel progress on a pickaxe, and to change requiums","title":"Command Summary"},{"location":"pyromining/#basic-drops-economy","text":"While mining ores in both the Overworld and the Nether, there is a chance for additional items to drop which are sellable for money, the standard server currency.

This state is indicated by your pickaxe being temporarily renamed with the vessel name. Vessel boss - refers to the mob that must be fought, whose defeat applies the enchantment to the pickaxe Vessel enchantment - refers to the enchantment on the pickaxe after defeating the boss The wording here does not necessarily reflect the verbage used by the plugin developers, but is written such that it is hopefully more clear to you as a player. Vessels are a handful of things but ultimately they are custom enchantments for pickaxes that you have to put work into. Once you have crafted a vessel item from a refinery, you can apply that vessel item to a pickaxe by dragging it and clicking it onto your pickaxe. Performing this action initiates a vessel progression specific to that pickaxe. The vessel item is the only state in which vessels are transferable between players. Obtaining a vessel item and applying it to your pickaxe is not the end that gets you a fancy new enchantment on your pickaxe, but rather a beginning of a process to get that enchantment.","title":"Vessels (Custom Enchantments)"},{"location":"pyromining/#vessel-progression","text":"The vessel progression is the long, bumpy road to getting a vessel enchantment on your pickaxe. When you apply the vessel item to the pickaxe, your pickaxe will be renamed to indicate the vessel enchantment towards which you are now working. You may only have one vessel progression applied to a pickaxe at a time, and the same vessel type does not stack for progression. During the vessel progression, use your pickaxe normally, but know that each ore you mine could be the death of you, as there is now a chance for the vessel boss to spawn. This spawn chance is extremely low \u2013 less than 1%, but you should stay weary as vessel bosses are not meant to be easy. The vessel boss is not the only creature you could encounter during the vessel progression. Thralls are small mobs (silverfish) which also emerge from the ores you mine on occasion. As you kill these little critters, you gain Requium XP, or anger, towards your vessel progression. The timespan with which you deal with the vessel progression is affected by your preparedness in another area: requiums. Each vessel progression, even for the same vessel type, requires a different requium ordering. Without the correct requium ordering, you are not permitted to kill the vessel boss.","title":"Vessel Progression"},{"location":"pyromining/#fossils","text":"Unidentified fossils are obtained from identifying artifacts. To identify a fossil, place it back in /mine artifacts. The time to identify a fossil is one hour. Fossils come from three different creatures: dragon, manticore, and phoenix, and there are 13 uniquely named creatures which translate directly into 13 unique Vessels. An unidentified fossil will indicate the creature type, while an identified fossil will assign a name to it. There are eight fossil parts belonging to each vessel creature: skull, arm, spine, rib, tail, wing, leg, and foot. Having all eight of those parts for a single creature will allow you to craft a vessel item in a refinery. See refinery page for information on converting your identified fossil collection into a vessel item. Each vessel costs Zeta and requires a minimum PyroMining level to be crafted from fossils.

You can improve your chances of obtaining requium orbs from artifacts by upgrading the Final Whisper passive in the /mine artifacts menu. There are 12 different orbs which can be collected, and thus required at random: Aleph, Bet, Daleth, Gimel, Heh, Het, Tet, Vav, Yud, Yud Aleph, Yud Bet, and Zayin. Three random requium orbs are required to kill each vessel boss. To use them, head to the /mine vessels menu with your vessel-progressing pickaxe in your inventory. Once you\u2019ve opened the menu, pick up your pickaxe. This will select it for the menu so that any requiums you move are directly associated with that particular pickaxe. The anvil\u2019s wording says \u201cClick Your Pickaxe.\u201d With your pickaxe loaded, you should now be able to freely move requium orbs into and out of the three slots below the iron bars. Simply exit the menu to save your chosen requium placements. When you are fighting the vessel boss, these slots are checked for what requiums you have placed in them, consecutively. If it performs the check and the requium orb is correct, the vessel boss\u2019 \u201cshield\u201d partly breaks down and you may continue to fight the vessel boss. If it performs the check but finds an incorrect requium orb in the slot, the vessel boss immediately starts a despawn counter and soon thereafter disappears, leaving you with the knowledge that a particular requium orb does not go in a particular slot. Getting the correct ordering of requium orbs can be done by guesswork \u2013 set random requiums, and the next time the vessel boss spawns, see if they are consecutively correct. You\u2019ll receive a chat message with the requium mentioned in green when it is correct, and the /mine vessels menu will then update to state the requium for that slot since you\u2019ve figured it out. This is not a particularly efficient method, though, as there are 12 possible requiums and 3 slots that you\u2019d have to guess correctly, changing them out for each new spawn of the vessel boss just to guess. It is recommended, though, to set the first one or two requiums immediately after applying the vessel item to your pickaxe, so that you can at least start ticking requiums off the list at the first random spawn of the vessel boss. Failed attempts do not consume your requium orbs; they can be withdrawn after the vessel boss has despawned. Fortunately, there is a system that works toward directly telling you what each of the requiums should be, and that is through thralls and requium XP (also called \u201canger\u201d). See below for more details on thralls and their role in the vessel progression. Note that the requium ordering for one vessel progression differs from the requium ordering for other vessel progressions. For instance, if you\u2019ve applied Valakas Nightfall to your pickaxe, and used the requiums Yud Bet, Aleph, and Vav when you defeated Valakas the first time, the next time you are working towards Valakas Nightfall may instead require Yud Aleph, Bet, and Zayin to defeat Valakas again, or any other combination of requiums. If you have placed all three requiums correctly, you will be able to proceed with killing the vessel boss. Defeating the vessel boss returns three shattered requium orbs and immediately applies the vessel enchantment to the pickaxe on which the vessel progression was applied (and returns the pickaxe\u2019s name to normal as well). This is the end of the vessel progression and, as the PyroMining informational menus say it, you have defeated the vessel. Shattered Requium Orbs: Obtainable from refining mysterious dust and after defeating a vessel boss (three are dropped from killing the vessel boss). These represent fragments of a requium orb, and every four shattered pieces can be recombined to form a random requium orb. To convert, hold a stack of four or more shattered requium orbs and right click. Four of them will be consumed and you will be given a requium orb in their place which can then be used as normal.","title":"Requium Orbs"},{"location":"pyromining/#thralls","text":"Thralls are small hostile mobs \u2013 specifically silverfish \u2013 which have a small chance to spawn when you are mining ores using a pickaxe imbued with a vessel progression. A vessel progression is so-called (here, at least) primarily because of the succession of \u201canger\u201d that a vessel develops. The anger stat can be viewed after selecting your pickaxe when in the /mine vessels menu, and the levels include Indifferent (default), Annoyed (100%-199% anger), Furious (200-299% anger), and Fuming (300-399% anger). The value in anger, though, is its percentage increase on each requium slot (seen by hovering over the iron bars in /mine vessels). When the anger for a requium slot reaches 100%, the expected requium orb for that slot is revealed. Anger towards requium slots affects one slot at a time and proceeds in order. It can be progressed such that you\u2019re eventually told all three required requiums. Each thrall you kill increases the anger percentage. The XP yield from thralls can be upgraded with the Requium Progress passive in /mine singularity. Without upgrades, it takes around 14+ thralls to reveal a required requium. You can increase your chance of spawning thralls with Necros Realm on your pickaxe. Anger resets for each new vessel progression.","title":"Thralls"},{"location":"pyromining/#vessel-miniboss","text":"To finish applying a vessel to your pickaxe, you must defeat the vessel boss. The vessel boss has a very small chance to spawn when you mine ores with your pickaxe having the vessel progression. When the boss has spawned, you will temporarily lose access to /mine vessels and the requiums that you have set at the time will be used to attempt to defeat the boss. The vessel boss continues to have a chance to respawn until you have defeated it. The level of the vessel boss, and its corresponding thralls, will depend on the total number of vessels you have already applied to your pickaxe. Eg. if you have Nagyns Tranquility II and Valaks Nightfall I on your pickaxe, the vessel boss will be level 4.
