# Armor
This server features 18 custom armor types, all of which are obtained either by mob drop or by [fragment crafting](#fragments-crafting). All custom armor have four [tiers](#tiers).

## Tiers
All custom armor have four tiers, marked by the number of stars (✪) in a piece's name. [Craftable custom armor](#fragments-crafting) tiers are set according to the tiers of the fragments used to craft them. [Dropped custom armor](#armor-drops) tiers are randomized, with higher tiers being more rare. 

Some armor sets scale harder than others. For example, tier (✪) of armor set A may have lower stats than tier (✪) of armor set B, but tier (✪✪✪✪) of armor set A may have higher stats than tier (✪✪✪✪) of armor set B.

## Armor Drops
Many armor pieces are random drops from custom mobs. Some armor pieces are more rare than others. With some exceptions, each tier higher of armor has half the chance of the previous tier to drop. This means that a tier (✪✪✪✪) armor piece has 1/64th the chance of a tier (✪) armor piece to drop.

Armor that is dropped from mobs can be crafted into a higher tier. For example, 4x "Tier ✪ Leaf Boots" can be placed in a crafting interface to upgrade them to 1x "Tier ✪✪ Leaf Boots".

## Fragments (Crafting)
Armor that cannot be dropped can be crafted by combining their respective fragments in regular armor patterns.

Lower-tier fragments can be used to craft higher-tier fragments by combining four of the same levelled fragment.

Higher-tier fragments can be crafted into lower-tier fragments, and armor can be dismantled back into fragments. Both are done by placing the singular fragment or armor piece in a crafting menu.

Fragments follow the same scaling drop chances that armor does. This means that a tier (✪✪✪✪) fragment has 1/64th the chance of a tier (✪) fragment to drop.
