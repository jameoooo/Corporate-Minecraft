## **AngelChest**

All players, upon dying, will leave behind a grave at their location of death. Once respawned, players are given:
- The coordinates of their grave via chat
- A compass that points to their grave
Graves last for <u>10 minutes</u>. Once the ten minutes are up, the contents of the chest are dropped on the ground. Only the player who dies has access to the chest. A player can have a maximum of 5 chests; once the max is exceeded, items from the first chest drop on the ground.

BlockLocker allows players to lock their private chests, furnaces, barrels, and any other containers from being used by other players. BlockLocker can also lock doors of all types.

## **Multiverse**

There are currently SIX realms available on the server. The first three are standard Minecraft dimensions, with more advanced terrain generation:

#### Grynn:
![Alt text](img/features/Grynn.png)

#### Scorch:
![Alt text](img/features/Scorch.png)

#### Veil:
![Alt text](img/features/Veil.png)

Once these three dimensions are beat by the player (including killing all custom bosses) they can access the Shattered Realms, uniquely generated worlds that offer entirely new experiences:

#### Airthaal:
![Alt text](img/features/Airthaal.png)

#### Nohrm:
![Alt text](img/features/Nohrm.png)

After beating these dimensions, players will be able to travel to Iskk, a harsh world made entirely out of snow biomes.

## **Custom Mobs**

This server features over 100 custom mobs, each of which has its own unique flare, drops, loadouts, etc.

Some custom mobs have 

## **Custom Bosses**

This server features eight custom bosses. Of the first three dimensions (Grynn, Scorch, and Nohrm), there are one boss each with a fourth boss able to be summoned after killing all three. The Shattered Realms dimensions (Airthaal and Nohrm) follow a similar structure - one boss on each world, and a final boss summoned after killing them. Iskk has a boss as well.

***These bosses are meant to be very difficult.*** You should come as prepared as possible to fight them. Or cheese them, if you want to ruin all of my hard work.

![Alt text](img/features/CustomMob.png)

## **Custom Items**

This server features over a hundred custom items, ranging largely from armor to weapons. These are discussed in more detail in [Custom Items](./custom_items.md).

## **Pets**
Pets are purchased with money and can be used for a variety of purposes. Upon purchasing a pet, you will be prompted to select a *skill tree* for the pet - skill trees cannot be changed and determine what the pet can do. Some skill trees allow for a stronger combat pet, others allow for rideable pets or pet inventories. More pet info can be found on the [MyPet Wiki](https://wiki.mypet-plugin.de/)

Pets gain XP by killing mobs.

#### **Commands**
- /petshop - opens the pet shop
- /pets - view your pet storage
- /petstore - stores your active pet

## **Slimefun**
Slimefun is a plugin that adds hundreds of materials, machines, tools, and armor to Minecraft. Slimefun’s full documentation can be found on the [Slimefun Wiki](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki)

A few items have been removed for balancing purposes, with the goal of making it so that you shouldn’t have to use Slimefun to have a good experience. It’s meant to be a neat addition to the vanilla game, especially the late game.

#### Commands:
- /sf guide - gives the user a Slimefun book. Right-clicking with the book in hand opens Slimefun’s user-friendly GUI.
- /sf open_book - opens the Slimefun book without needing it in your inventory
- /sf search <query> - searches the Slimefun book
- /sf stats <player> - shows a player’s (or your own) Slimefun stats

## **Tags**
In chat, you will have a tag next to your name. More tags are earned by completing achievements, which can be viewed using /aach list. Achievements that give a tag for completing are marked by (TAG) in the achievement's description. Most tags are the same as the achievement necessary to obtain them, but not all.

## **ViaVersion**
Corporate Minecraft runs on 1.20.2 due to plugin compatibility issues - but ViaVersion allows you to join from a variety of Minecraft versions. This has not been thoroughly tested. ***I would not joing from any version before 1.20.2.***
