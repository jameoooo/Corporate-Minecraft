## **1.0.1**
###### <u>Release Date: 6/25/25</u>
- Armor that was previously only obtainable via mob drop (Leaf, Druid, etc.) can now be upgraded by placing four of one tier in a crafting interface (ex. 4 "Tier ✪ Leaf Boots" can be crafted into 1 "Tier ✪✪ Leaf Boots")
- Adjusted several things to account for mob difficulty and drops that were too high:
  - Game difficulty changed to normal
  - Custom armor drop chances lowered
  - Custom mobs spawn less often
  - Custom mobs that do spawn have weapons less often
- Fixed a bug where tags would only appear client-side
